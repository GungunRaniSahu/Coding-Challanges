/*Task
Write a program which does the following:

Display the sum, product, and quotient of 2 integers - -50 & 40.
Initialize the following variables in your program and use them in the computation
Variable a and assign it the value -50
Variable b and assign it the value 40
Variables sum, product and quotient - assign the relevant values to them
Note - sum, product and quotient need to be integers
Output sum, product and quotient to the console on separate lines*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

  int a = -50;
  int b = 40;
  int sum = a + b;
  int product = a * b;
  int quotient = a / b;
  printf("%d\n", sum);
  printf("%d\n", product);
  printf("%d", quotient);
